# spacy-annotator

SpaCy annotator for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using ipywidgets.
The annotator allows users to quickly assign (custom) labels to one or more entities in the text, including noisy-prelabelling!   

**Features**:

* The annotator supports pandas dataframe: it adds annotations in a separate 'annotation' column of the dataframe;
* Why not use transformers to label your data for you? 
If a model is passed into the annotator, it is used to identify entities and pre-fill the annotator for you.
* The annotations adhere to spaCy format and are ready to serve as input to a spaCy NER model.   
No additional code required!

## References

spacy-annotator is based on [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [pigeon](https://github.com/agermanidis/pigeon) (see also [PigeonXT](https://github.com/dennisbakhuis/pigeonXT)).   
Many thanks to them for making their awesome libraries publicly available. Another interesting project is [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano).

**Note**:
spaCy is a great library and, most importantly, free to use. So please also consider using the https://prodi.gy/ annotator to keep supporting the spaCy deveopment.
